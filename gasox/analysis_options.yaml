# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  prefer_const_constructors: false # Enforces the use of const constructors where possible
  prefer_final_locals: false # Encourages the use of final for local variables
  prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: false  # Encourages the use of const for immutable collections
  use_key_in_widget_constructors: false  # Enforces the use of keys in widget constructors
  prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables: false  # Enforces const constructors in immutable classes
  avoid print: false  # Discourages the use of print statements in production code
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
